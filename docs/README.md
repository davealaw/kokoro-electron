# Documentation

This folder contains project documentation organized by purpose.

## Structure

- **`development/`** _(ignored by Git)_ - Internal development documents, testing reports, and work-in-progress documentation that shouldn't be published
- **`user/`** _(future)_ - User-facing documentation like guides, tutorials, and API references
- **`contributor/`** _(future)_ - Developer guides, architecture docs, and contribution instructions

## Current Contents

## Adding Documentation

- **Public documentation** (user guides, API docs) → Add to Git and publish
- **Internal documentation** (testing reports, dev notes) → Add to `development/` folder (auto-ignored)
- **Temporary documentation** → Use `development/` folder for work-in-progress docs

The `development/` folder is excluded from version control to keep the repository clean while preserving important internal documentation locally.
